DHW distribution losses estimated mainly based on `Energiatehokkuus 2018 (Finnish Ministry of the Environment)`. DHW tank standby losses assumed non-utilisable, whereas 35% of distribution losses are assumed utilisable according to `Production and distribution of domestic hot water in selected Danish apartment buildings and institutions.
