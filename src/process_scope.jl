    process_building_stock_scope(scope::Object; mod::Module = @__MODULE__)

Process the aggregated `building_stock_statistic` properties of a `scope`.

NOTE! The `mod` keyword changes from which Module data is accessed from,
`@__MODULE__` by default.

Returns the gross-floor area weighted total `number_of_buildings` and
`average_gross_floor_area_m2_per_building` defined by the `building_scope` and its associated relationships.
Furthermore, returns the gross-floor area weights for the `building_type__building_period__location_id` useful
for weighting the structural and fenestration/ventilation data.

Essentially, performs the following steps:
1. Filter out irrelevant building stock statistics and check there are any left.
2. Calculate the gross-floor area weights using [`calculate_gross_floor_area_weights`](@ref).
3. Aggregate the gross-floor area weights using [`aggregate_gfa_weights`](@ref).
4. Return the necessary pieces to construct a [`ScopeData`](@ref).
