    )

Solve the heating/cooling demand of the `archetype`.

Note that this function calculates the "final energy demand" of the archetype
building, and not the energy consumption of it's HVAC systems.
Furthermore, the calculations are deterministic, with `realization` defining
the true data from potentially stochastic input.
See the [`solve_consumption`](@ref) function for that.
Essentially, performs the following steps:
1. Check external load data and [`determine_temporal_structure`](@ref).
2. [`form_and_invert_dynamics_matrix`](@ref) for the free temperature dynamics.
3. Initialize external load an thermal mass vectors using [`initialize_rhs`](@ref).
4. Initialize temperature and temperature limit vectors using [`initialize_temperatures`](@ref).
5. Solve the heating demand using [`solve_heating_demand_loop`](@ref).
6. Rearrange the solution into `Dict`s and return them.

Uses an extremely simple rule-based control to solve the heating/cooling
demand of the archetype building. The controller intervenes
whenever node temperatures would deviate from permitted limits,
and provides the required energy input to maintain the system at the limit.

The building dynamics are discretized using implicit *(backwards)* Euler,
mainly for consistency with our existing energy system modelling tools
like Backbone or SpineOpt. In principle, I believe the system could be solved
analytically similar to my Master's Thesis, if better accuracy would be desired:
*Energy Management in Households with Coupled Photovoltaics and Electric Vehicles, Topi Rasku, 2015, Aalto University School of Science*.

The idea of solving heating demand calculations can be as follows,
starting from the energy balance equation for node `n`
```math
C_n \\frac{dT_n(t)}{dt} = - \\rho_n T_n(t) + \\sum_{m \\in N} \\left[ H_{n,m} \\left( T_m(t) - T_n(t) \\right) \\right] + \\Phi_n(t),
```
where `C_n` is the heat capacity of node `n`,
`T_n(t)` is the time-dependent temperature of node `n` at time `t`,
`ρ_n` is the self-discharge from node `n`,
`N` is the set of temperature nodes in the lumped-capacitance model of the building,
`H_n,m` is the heat transfer coefficient between nodes `n` and `m`,
and `Φ_n(t)` is the time-dependent total external heat load on node `n`.
Using the implicit Euler discretization, the above can be cast into
```math
\\left( \\frac{C_n}{\\Delta t} + \\rho_n + \\sum_{m \\in N} H_{n,m} \\right) T_{n,t} - \\sum_{m \\in N} \\left[ H_{n,m} T_{m,t} \\right] = \\Phi_{n,t} + \\frac{C_n}{\\Delta t} T_{n,t-\\Delta t},
```
where `Δt` is the length of the discretized time step.
Since we always know the temperatures on the previous time step `t-Δt`,
the above can be expressed in matrix form and solved as
```math
\\bm{A} \\hat{T} = \\hat{\\Phi}, \\\\
\\hat{T} = \\bm{A}^{-1} \\hat{\\Phi},
```
where `A` is the so-called *dynamics matrix*, 
`T` is the current temperature vector,
and `Φ` is the right-hand side vector, containing the effect of external loads
and previous temperatures.

The above is used to calculate the temperatures of the nodes on each subsequent
time step. However, when any of the node temperatures would violate the defined
minimum and maximum permitted temperatures, that temperature variable is instead
fixed to the violated boundary, moved to the right-hand side,
and replaced with a heating/cooling demand variable `ϕ_m` instead.
This results in a slightly modified problem to be solved
```math
\\hat{\\phi} = \\left( \\bm{A} - \\sum_{m \\in M}[\\bm{A}_{m} + \\bm{I}_{m}] \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\hat{\\Phi} - \\sum_{m \\in M}[\\hat{A}_{m} T'_m] \\right),
```
where `ϕ` is the modified temperature vector with the fixed temperature replaced
with the heating/cooling demand variable,
`m ∈ M` are the nodes that would violate their permitted bounds,
and are therefore fixed at the boundary `T'_m`,
`A_m` represents a selection of column `m` from the matrix `A`,
and `I_m` represents column `m` from an identity matrix.
Please note that there are both matrix and vector selections of `A_m`,
where the matrix selection preserves the dimensions with filling zeroes,
while the vector selection is essentially only the selected column in vector form.
