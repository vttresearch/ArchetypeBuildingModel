A Julia module for aggregating building stock data into desired archetype building lumped-capacitance thermal models.

The goal of this module is to aggregate building stock data into arbitrary
simplified lumped-capacitance thermal models representing the flexible
heating/cooling demand of the underlying building stock for large-scale
energy system models like [Backbone](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/publications/backbone)
or [SpineOpt](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl).
Requires building stock data processed by e.g. [FinnishBuildingStockData.jl](https://github.com/vttresearch/FinnishBuildingStockData) or similar,
as well as archetype building definitions according to the template provided in `archetype_definitions.json` as input.
For automatic weather data processing, this module uses the Python sub-module `archetypebuildingweather`.


## Key contents

1. `archetype_definitions.json`, a template for the Spine data structure required for defining the archetype buildings.
2. `process_archetype_buildings.jl`, the main program file for archetype building processing using Spine Toolbox.
3. `process_archetype_buildings.json`, the [Spine Toolbox](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox) tool specification for the main program above.
4. `testscript.jl`, a testing script/tutorial for using this module.
5. `testscript.ipynb`, a testing notebook/tutorial for using the `archetypebuildingweather` sub-module.
6. `src/ArchetypeBuildingModel.jl`, the main Julia module file.
7. `src/archetypebuildingweather/` contains the Python sub-module for automatic weather data processing.
8. `data/` contains data related to the automatic weather data processing.
9. `examples/` contains example definitions for `building_fabrics`, `building_systems`, and `building_weather`.
10. `figs/` contains automatically output diagnostic figures about the automatic weather data aggregation. 


## ArchetypeBuildingWeather.py

A Python sub-module for processing weather data.

This package contains the necessary functions for aggregating ERA5 weather data
using [`PyPSA/atlite`](https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite) for large geographical
areas described using a shapefile, a set of weights connected to the
shapefile, and an optional raster data file also used for weighting.
Essentially, the operating workflow of the module goes as follows:

1. Load a *shapefile* defining the scope of weather data for `atlite`, and fetch the data.
2. Assign the given *weights* to the *shapefile*, and include the optional *raster* data if defined.
3. Downsample and normalize the *weight raster* generated above to match ERA5 resolution.
4. Calculate the aggregated weather parameters required by `ArchetypeBuildingModel.jl`.


## Installation

Unfortunately, this module has quite complicated dependencies due to
[`SpineInterface.jl`](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineInterface.jl) and
[`PYPSA/atlite`](https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite) needing to operate using a
single python environment accessible via [`PyCall`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl).
Thus, it needs quite a specific python environment to be set up and linked with
[`SpineInterface.jl`](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineInterface.jl).
Here's a rough sketch of how I got it working:

1. Create a conda environment with python 3.8, e.g. `conda create -n toolboxatlite python=3.8` and activate it.
2. Install [Spine Toolbox](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox) from a local source via `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the Toolbox root folder.
3. Install `PYPSA/atlite` via `conda install -c conda-forge atlite`
4. Install the `ArchetypeBuildingWeather.py` sub-module via `pip install -e .` in the `src/` folder.
5. Install JupyterLab via `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`.


## Usage

This module is intended to be used as a part of a [Spine Toolbox](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox) workflow,
with the following rough steps:

1. Create a Spine Datastore with building stock data processed by e.g. [FinnishBuildingStockData.jl](https://github.com/vttresearch/FinnishBuildingStockData).
2. Import `archetype_definitions.json` on top of the processed building stock data.
3. Define the desired `building_archetype` objects, and connect them to the relevant `building_fabrics`, `building_loads`, `building_scope`, and `building_system` objects. *(`building_weather` is optional, and will be automatically generated if missing.)*
4. Use the `process_archetype_buildings.json` tool to process the data and definitions into the desired energy system model input.

In case you need to familiarize yourself with the inner workings of this module,
see `testscript.jl` for examples on how to use the `ArchetypeBuildingModel.jl`,
and `testscript.ipynb` for examples on how to use the `ArchetypeBuildingWeather.py` sub-module.
Note that it is recommended to store the relevant geographical information system (GIS)
data used via the module within the `data/` folder in the repository for the moment.


## Documentation

[Online documentation can be found here](https://vttresearch.github.io/ArchetypeBuildingModel/),
but I haven't bothered to set up automatic workflow for keeping it up to date.
Thus, for accessing the latest documentation, one has to build it locally.

In order to build and read the documentation locally,
start a Julia REPL from the root folder of this module and perform the following steps:

1. Activate the `documentation` environment from the Julia Package manager
```julia
julia> ]
(ArchetypeBuildingModel) pkg> Activate documentation
(documentation) pkg> ]
julia>
```

2. Run the `documentation/make.jl` script to build the documentation.
```julia
julia> include("documentation/make.jl")
```

3. Open the newly built `documentation/build/index.html` to start browsing the documentation.
